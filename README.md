This study assesses the impact of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) on household income in India. It uses the India Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II) dataset and a weighted least squares regression approach to address heteroskedasticity. The analysis controls for a range of demographic, socio-economic, and consumption variables. We expect that participation in MGNREGA will be positively associated with household income by providing guaranteed wage employment and supporting asset creation. Additionally, factors such as urban residence, higher educational attainment, and increased consumption expenditure are expected to further contribute to higher income levels. These findings have important implications for future policy designs related to demographic job creation and income analysis. However, the study is limited by its cross-sectional design.
